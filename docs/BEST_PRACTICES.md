# AWS DevOps Best Practices - Infrastructure as Code

This document outlines the DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices implemented in this project.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices

### 1. Terraform Best Practices

- ✅ Version control all infrastructure code
- ✅ Clear variable definitions with descriptions

#### State Management
- ✅ Remote state backend (S3 + DynamoDB)
- ✅ State locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- ✅ Encrypted state files
- ✅ State versioning enabled

#### Security
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in code
- ✅ Use IAM roles and policies properly
- ✅ Enable encryption at rest and in transit

- ✅ Validation before apply (`terraform validate`)
- ✅ Plan review before applying changes
- ✅ Meaningful resource naming

### 2. Kubernetes Best Practices

#### Resource Organization

- ✅ Multiple replicas for applications
- ✅ Load balancing

#### Backup & Recovery
- ✅ State file versioning

- ✅ Single NAT Gateway (cost optimization)
- ✅ Auto-scaling to match demand
- ✅ Spot instances option available

#### Monitoring & Alerts
- ✅ Cost tracking tags
- ✅ Resource utilization monitoring
- ✅ Idle resource identification
- ✅ Budget alerts (can be configured)

### 8. Security Best Practices

#### Network Security
- ✅ VPC with private subnets
- ✅ Security groups with minimal access
- ✅ Network segmentation
- ✅ TLS/SSL encryption

#### Access Control
- ✅ IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)
- ✅ RBAC in Kubernetes
- ✅ Least privilege principle
- ✅ Regular access reviews

#### Secrets Management
- ✅ Kubernetes secrets
- ✅ Encrypted secrets at rest
- ✅ No secrets in code
- ✅ Secret rotation capability

#### Compliance
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Compliance tags
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Policy enforcement

### 9. GitOps Practices

#### Version Control
- ✅ All infrastructure as code
- ✅ All configs version controlled
- ✅ Meaningful commit messages
- ✅ Branch protection rules

#### Code Review
- ✅ Pull request workflow
- ✅ Automated checks on PRs
- ✅ Terraform plan in PR comments
- ✅ Required approvals (can be enforced)

#### Deployment
- ✅ Declarative configuration
- ✅ Automated sync
- ✅ Rollback capability
- ✅ Audit trail

### 10. Documentation

#### Code Documentation
- ✅ Clear README files
- ✅ Inline comments where necessary
- ✅ Architecture diagrams
- ✅ API documentation

#### Operational Documentation
- ✅ Deployment guides
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Runbooks
- ✅ Best practices guide
